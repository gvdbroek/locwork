# locwork

A simple cli tool written for my own convenience.


## Usage

## Installation

You should be able to install directly from github, just run this command.
```shell
pip install --user git+https://github.com/gvdbroek/locwork/
```

After that, you should be able to run the command as such.

```shell
python -m locwork
```
